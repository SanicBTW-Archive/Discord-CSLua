# A Discord bot made with LUA (kind of)

This is just meant to start working with LUA and start understanding how to add support for it in other languages and use it as well

This project uses (NuGet packages): 
- NLua for the LUA Bridge
- Discord.Net for the Discord API Wrapper (I'm tired of using DSharpPlus)

I know I still have a long way to improve my LUA scripts and usage but this is a good start
